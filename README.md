This is my personal project, "Machine mods"
I had wrote the Front-end of this website, and made a responsive website using my skills and knowledge. Whereas when it comes to the backend I am still in the learning process
so that the, this project is far from over.
But you will be amazed once I complete this porject, which isn't going to take long.

## Suggestions are accepted, and if you are willing to give me a hand, I would love to collaborate with you. Thank You!!!
